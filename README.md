Cisticola
==========

The *cisticola* application enables users to easily collect, process, and analyze large-scale data from several social media platforms.

It scrapes raw data by coordinating with a set of platform-specific scrapers, archives media attachments, and stores the data in a SQL database.

For more information about the structure of Cisticola, as well as installation and deployment instructions, see the [documentation](https://cisticola.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
